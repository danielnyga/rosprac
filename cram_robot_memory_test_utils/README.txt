This package provides utilities that are useful to test the cram_robot_memory package in a simulation environment.
It provides methods for spawning a PR2 robot in a kitchen, for spawning objects, for executing plans in the environment, as well as function for executing test and training functions such that MLNs are automatically learned. All the simulation related methods are implemented for bullet, but they could also be implemented for gazebo in the future.
