This package provides messages and services used by the owl_memory_converter and robot_memory to communicate.
It is intended to publish a CRAM log file on a ROS topic.  However, the messages can also be used to publish the executed functions of a running CRAM plan.  The message published to the topic is the RobotState message describing the state of a CRAM plan in execution. Thus, there are two RobotState messages for each task in a log file: One is sent with finished=false when the task is started. Then, the sub tasks are published. Afterwards, a RobotState message with finished=true is published. Since the order is important, there is a sequence number in the RobotState message. Finally, the learningTrigger service is called. To make sure that all required messages are received, the number_of_required_messages specifying the number of sent RobotState messages are passed as parameter. Another parameter specifies whether the learned MLN shall be updated.
